## About

This is a page that shows clients, posts, and comments. The first page you will see shows the 10 clients. When you click on "See Post", it will take you to the Post view with the Post component. There you will see around 10 post. With in each post there is a dropdown that will show the comments associated with the Post, which I believe there is around 5 comments for each post. The comments come from the Comment component that is injected in the Post component. The Home button on the top will take you back the main page, which is the client page.
